## Efficient Prompting for LLM-Based Generative IoT (GIoT) Systems
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT), termed AIoT, has been widely adopted across various domains such as healthcare, smart cities, and industrial automation. Traditional AIoT systems rely on task-specific machine learning models, often deployed on cloud or edge servers. However, with the advent of Generative AI (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), a new paradigm called Generative IoT (GIoT) is emerging, offering enhanced adaptability and intelligence for IoT applications.

Despite their advantages, LLM-based GIoT systems face significant challenges, including high computational demands, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues. This study proposes an efficient LLM-based GIoT system that addresses these challenges by deploying open-source LLMs on edge servers in a local network. The system includes a Prompt Management Module and a Postprocessing Module, which enhance adaptability and performance for various IoT tasks through tailored prompting techniques.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we implement a semi-structured Table Question Answering (Table-QA) service, a complex yet valuable task for analyzing tabular data. We introduce a three-stage prompting method (task-planning, task-conducting, and task-correction) that improves reasoning accuracy and reduces inference costs. Our experiments on WikiTableQA and TabFact datasets validate the approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods.

## LLM-Based Test Case Generation for Quality Assurance (QA)
Software testing is an essential phase of software development, often accounting for 30-50% of total development costs. The growing complexity of modern systems and the rise of agile and DevOps practices have heightened the need for automated testing. Large Language Models (LLMs) with coding capabilities have emerged as potential tools for assisting in tasks like code generation, bug fixing, and test case creation. However, their application in Quality Assurance (QA) remains underexplored.

Key challenges in LLM-based test case generation include:
- **Incompleteness:** Missing critical scenarios leading to inadequate testing.
- **Inconsistency:** Variability in style, quantity, and coverage.
- **Naivety:** Misinterpretation of domain-specific requirements.
- **Security risks:** Potential exposure of confidential corporate data in cloud-hosted LLMs.

To address these concerns, this study evaluates different open-source LLMs for test case generation and proposes an on-premises LLM solution based on the LLaMA 70B family of models. The research aims to improve test case quality through optimized prompting strategies, alignment techniques, and model architecture selection, ultimately advancing LLM-powered QA automation.

## Vector Databases and Semantic Search
### Introduction
The realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen advancements thanks to the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), changing the way we handle data, understand information, and create natural language. These models, well-trained on datasets, possess the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. This capability allows them to be applied in areas such as automated content creation and sophisticated conversational agents.

However, despite their capabilities, LLMs come with limitations that involve issues related to timeliness, accuracy, and efficient data extraction from datasets. These challenges underscore the importance of strategies to enhance the utility of LLMs, especially in domains where precise and up-to-date information is crucial.

One effective strategy for addressing these limitations involves integrating Vector Databases (Vector DB) with LLMs. Vector DBs are systems for storing and retrieving data efficiently. They offer an approach for organizing, searching, and managing datasets using embeddings. Embeddings serve as vector representations of data that improve the information retrieval processes of LLM operations by providing a search capability that is rich in meaning.

This research aims to explore the use of Vector Databases in Large Language Model applications as a solution to address their limitations. We first examine the constraints of Large Language Models, identifying obstacles that hinder their widespread adoption and effectiveness. Then, we explore how Vector Databases can improve Large Language Models by focusing on the fundamentals and practical methods for integrating them. Our objective is to find ways to combine Language Models with Vector Databases to demonstrate how this integration can enhance the capabilities of these models and provide a roadmap for AI research. By merging these technologies, we strive to make progress in advancing the development of more efficient and adaptable systems.

### Limitations of Large Language Models in Generative AI Use Cases
Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations that can impede their practical application, especially in scenarios requiring high precision, timeliness, and specificity. While LLMs are at the forefront of the Generative AI revolution, they may not be well-suited for tasks with high demands. These limitations primarily arise from how the models are designed, trained, and operated.

1. **Hallucinations:** One significant issue with LLMs is known as hallucinations or misinterpretations, where the model tends to generate information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect or nonsensical. This challenge stems from the models relying on patterns in their training data rather than verifiable facts. Consequently, this can be problematic in applications where accuracy is crucial.
   
2. **Stagnant Data Pool:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a dataset that becomes outdated over time, limiting their effectiveness in situations requiring up-to-date information. The fixed nature of their training data makes it challenging for them to adapt to information post-training, thereby reducing their usefulness for tasks involving current events or evolving knowledge domains.
   
3. **Challenges with Local Data Integration:** LLMs sometimes encounter difficulties incorporating or utilizing domain-specific or personalized data due to their generalized training approach. Without instruction on how to use this information, which may not always be feasible or realistic, large language models struggle to seamlessly integrate it. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in niche fields or tailored uses where integrating datasets could significantly enhance performance and applicability.

### Strategies for Overcoming LLM Limitations with Vector DB Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation
To expand the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond their training data, it is crucial to adopt strategies that enhance their flexibility, precision, and awareness of various contexts. One effective approach to enriching the knowledge base of LLMs involves leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vector Databases (Vector DB).

Integrating RAG into the process can enhance information accuracy by including a retrieval step that accesses both external databases for relevant data before content generation. This practice helps minimize errors and inaccuracies in generated text. Vector DB, known for its retrieval of dimensional data, serves as a strong foundation for this method, enabling LLMs to access the most recent and validated information. By doing this, the technique significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of output content, ensuring coherence and factual correctness.

Incorporating Vector DB in the process empowers Language Models to tap into a database continually updated with new information, surpassing the constraints imposed by static datasets. This integration allows models to produce content that reflects the knowledge and facts accurately, overcoming limitations associated with fixed training datasets. Accessing up-to-date information in real time ensures that the results produced remain relevant and accurate in evolving fields.

By utilizing Vector DB, it becomes easier to incorporate domain-specific data into the process. Large Language Models can enhance their output by integrating datasets into a vector database, enabling them to retrieve and tailor the data to specific situations or needs. This functionality greatly enhances the adaptability and practicality of language models across fields, from offering personalized recommendations to providing technical support in specific domains.
