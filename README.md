\subsection{Efficient Prompting for LLM-Based Generative IoT (GIoT) Systems}

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) \cite{guo2024large} with the Internet of Things (IoT), termed AIoT, has been widely adopted across various domains such as healthcare, smart cities, and industrial automation. Traditional AIoT systems rely on task-specific machine learning models, often deployed on cloud or edge servers. However, with the advent of Generative AI (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), a new paradigm called Generative IoT (GIoT) is emerging, offering enhanced adaptability and intelligence for IoT applications.

Despite their advantages, LLM-based GIoT systems face significant challenges, including high computational demands, data privacy concerns, and scalability issues. This study proposes an efficient LLM-based GIoT system that addresses these challenges by deploying open-source LLMs on edge servers in a local network. The system includes a Prompt Management Module and a Postprocessing Module, which enhance adaptability and performance for various IoT tasks through tailored prompting techniques.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we implement a semi-structured Table Question Answering (Table-QA) service, a complex yet valuable task for analyzing tabular data. We introduce a three-stage prompting method (task-planning, task-conducting, and task-correction) that improves reasoning accuracy and reduces inference costs. Our experiments on WikiTableQA and TabFact datasets validate the approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods.

\subsection{LLM-Based Test Case Generation for Quality Assurance (QA)}

Software testing is an essential phase of software development, often accounting for 30-50\% of total development costs. The growing complexity of modern systems and the rise of agile and DevOps practices have heightened the need for automated testing(\cite{naimi2024new}). Large Language Models (LLMs) with coding capabilities have emerged as potential tools for assisting in tasks like code generation, bug fixing, and test case creation. However, their application in Quality Assurance (QA)(\cite{priya2024enhancing}) remains underexplored.

Key challenges in LLM-based test case generation include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Incompleteness}: Missing critical scenarios leading to inadequate testing.
    \item \textbf{Inconsistency}: Variability in style, quantity, and coverage.
    \item \textbf{Naivety}: Misinterpretation of domain-specific requirements.
    \item \textbf{Security risks}: Potential exposure of confidential corporate data in cloud-hosted LLMs.
\end{itemize}

To address these concerns, this study evaluates different open-source LLMs for test case generation and proposes an on-premises(\cite{yin2024leveraging}) LLM solution based on the LLaMA 70B family of models. The research aims to improve test case quality through optimized prompting strategies, alignment techniques, and model architecture selection, ultimately advancing LLM-powered QA automation.

\subsection{Vector Databases and Semantic Search}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
The realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen advancements thanks to the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), changing the way we handle data, understand information, and create natural language. These models, well-trained on datasets, possess the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. This capability allows them to be applied in areas such as automated content creation and sophisticated conversational agents.(\cite{jing2024large})

However, despite their capabilities, LLMs come with limitations that involve issues related to timeliness, accuracy, and efficient data extraction from datasets. These challenges underscore the importance of strategies to enhance the utility of LLMs, especially in domains where precise and up-to-date information is crucial.

One effective strategy for addressing these limitations involves integrating Vector Databases (Vector DB) with LLMs. Vector DBs are systems for storing and retrieving data efficiently. They offer an approach for organizing, searching, and managing datasets using embeddings. Embeddings serve as vector representations of data that improve the information retrieval processes of LLM operations by providing a search capability that is rich in meaning.

This research aims to explore the use of Vector Databases in Large Language Model applications as a solution to address their limitations. We first examine the constraints of Large Language Models, identifying obstacles that hinder their widespread adoption and effectiveness. Then, we explore how Vector Databases can improve Large Language Models by focusing on the fundamentals and practical methods for integrating them. Our objective is to find ways to combine Language Models with Vector Databases to demonstrate how this integration can enhance the capabilities of these models and provide a roadmap for AI research. By merging these technologies, we strive to make progress in advancing the development of more efficient and adaptable systems.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Limitations of Large Language Models in Generative AI Use Cases}
Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations that can impede their practical application, especially in scenarios requiring high precision, timeliness, and specificity. While LLMs are at the forefront of the Generative AI revolution, they may not be well-suited for tasks with high demands. These limitations primarily arise from how the models are designed, trained, and operated.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hallucinations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        One significant issue with LLMs is known as hallucinations or misinterpretations, where the model tends to generate information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect or nonsensical. This challenge stems from the models relying on patterns in their training data rather than verifiable facts. Consequently, this can be problematic in applications where accuracy is crucial.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Stagnant Data Pool:}
    \begin{itemize}
        Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a dataset that becomes outdated over time, limiting their effectiveness in situations requiring up-to-date information. The fixed nature of their training data makes it challenging for them to adapt to information post-training, thereby reducing their usefulness for tasks involving current events or evolving knowledge domains.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Challenges with Local Data Integration:}
    \begin{itemize}
        LLMs sometimes encounter difficulties incorporating or utilizing domain-specific or personalized data due to their generalized training approach. Without instruction on how to use this information, which may not always be feasible or realistic, large language models struggle to seamlessly integrate it. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in niche fields or tailored uses where integrating datasets could significantly enhance performance and applicability.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Strategies for Overcoming LLM Limitations with Vector DB Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation}
To expand the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond their training data, it is crucial to adopt strategies that enhance their flexibility, precision, and awareness of various contexts. One effective approach to enriching the knowledge base of LLMs involves leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vector Databases (Vector DB).

Integrating RAG into the process can enhance information accuracy by including a retrieval step that accesses both external databases for relevant data before content generation. This practice helps minimize errors and inaccuracies in generated text. Vector DB, known for its retrieval of dimensional data, serves as a strong foundation for this method, enabling LLMs to access the most recent and validated information. By doing this, the technique significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of output content, ensuring coherence and factual correctness.

Incorporating Vector DB in the process empowers Language Models to tap into a database continually updated with new information, surpassing the constraints imposed by static datasets. This integration allows models to produce content that reflects the knowledge and facts accurately, overcoming limitations associated with fixed training datasets. Accessing up-to-date information in real time ensures that the results produced remain relevant and accurate in evolving fields.

By utilizing Vector DB, it becomes easier to incorporate domain-specific data into the process. Large Language Models can enhance their output by integrating datasets into a vector database, enabling them to retrieve and tailor the data to specific situations or needs. This functionality greatly enhances the adaptability and practicality of language models across fields, from offering personalized recommendations to providing technical support in specific domains.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{RAG_with_Vector_DB.png}
    \caption{RAG with Vector DB}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}
In summary, combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Vector Databases provides a solution for overcoming the limitations of Large Language Models. This approach not only boosts the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also opens up new possibilities for their application, ensuring they can meet evolving needs in Generative AI with improved precision, updated data, and increased specificity. Researchers and industry professionals can take advantage of the scalable and context-aware features of Vector DBs to enhance the potential of LLMs, pushing the boundaries of AI technology forward.

\subsubsection{Architecture}
The system architecture is presented in Fig.\ref{fig:system_architecture}  .(\cite{kukreja2024performance}) The working of the system is divided into two parts. The large corpus from the selected dataset is fed as an input in the first part. The input is divided into smaller chunks (documents). These chunks are provided to the vector embedding model. This pre-trained vector embedding model will convert chunks into vectors. The generated vectors are stored in a vector database. The choice of selecting a vector database depends on the system requirements.

In the second part of the system architecture, the user will raise a query and expect an appropriate response concerning the context generated from the query. The query is also converted into vectors by the same vector embedding techniques used while creating the database through the embedding model. Based on generated vectors, semantic results are searched in the vector database. Top k documents which share a semantic meaning are retrieved from the vector database. These documents act as a context for the large language model. The LLM will act as a brain that takes user queries regarding embedding vectors and top k document embedding vectors as input. Based on the query input and context provided by the system, LLM will generate meaningful responses.
   \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/VectorArchitecture.png}
    \caption{System Architecture}
    \label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Embedding Models}

When an AI (Artificial Intelligence) system produces an output that may seem logical or believable but is not based on reality or factual information, it is referred to as \textit{AI hallucination}(\cite{singh2023analyzing}. These outputs may be text, graphics, or other data types that the AI model generated based on its training, but which might not be consistent with actual facts or logic.

A high-dimensional vector database has mathematically represented features or qualities, and is known as a vector database. Each vector can have anywhere between tens and thousands of dimensions. The data, including text, and data of multimedia types, is typically transformed or embedded to produce the vectors. The functionality can be based on a variety of techniques, including feature extraction algorithms, word embeddings, and machine learning models.

Similar images can be found using a vector database. According to the pixel resolution ratio of the image, the image search procedure should analyze the contents of the featured vector . Using machine learning sentiment analysis, this may locate files that are comparable to a particular content based on their topic. By these characteristics and ratings, it is used to locate items that are comparable to a specific product.

A query vector representing the requested data or criteria must be used to execute similar data in a vector database. Then, analysis can be done to determine how much they are near or far in the vector space. There are different metrics used for similarity measures, such as Cosine similarity, Hamming distance, and Euclidean Distance.

\subsubsection{Vector Embeddings}

Vector embeddings are essentially numerical representations of data. They mostly serve as representations for unstructured data, such as pictures, videos, audio, text, molecular images, and other types of data that lack a formal organization. Unstructured data is often considered to be harder to process.

Neural Networks are trained on different data sets, making each model's vector embedding unique. That’s why working with unstructured data and vector embeddings is challenging. Figure 1 depicts how input, hidden, and output layers work to yield different vector embeddings on different data sets.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Vector_embeddings_NN.png}
    \caption{Vector embeddings in Neural Network}
    \label{fig:vector_embeddings}
\end{figure}

\\
Vector search algorithms have a long research history, 
and most works focus on efficient approximate search on 
large-scale datasets.  Existing algorithms can be roughly 
classified into four categories, i.e., space partitioning tree 
(SPT), locality sensitive hashing (LSH), and vector
quantization (VQ) and proximity graph (PG). SPT 
algorithms divide the space into areas, and use tree 
structures to quickly narrow down search results to some 
areas. 
Embeddings vectors are used to encode and decode 
input and output texts, and can vary in size and dimension. / 
Embeddings can help the model understand the relationships 
between tokens, and generate relevant and coherent texts. 
They are used for text classification, summarization, 
translation, and generation, as well as image and code 
generation. 

A query result in multiple vector representations 
means that that query must be semantically similar in 
numerous ways. Try doing this with image models, 
different dimensionality language models or your data 
for the next steps. In this presentation the difference 
between some existing model and the proposed finetuned model has been verified. 
High performance: The effectiveness of vector 
databases' query processing is crucial. Implementations 
should be heavily hardware optimized for optimal 
performance. Additionally, the framework should be 
carefully planned to reduce system overheads associated 
with query serving. 
Strong adaptability: Customers now employ vector 
databases in a range of settings, from small-scale cloud 
deployments to large-scale laptop prototyping. A vector 
database should lessen the burden of moving code and data 
between environments and offer a consistent user 
experience.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hallucination Detection}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
In contemporary natural language processing research, text generation models like ChatGPT have achieved remarkable success in producing naturally fluent texts. However, these models tend to generate content that is either factually inconsistent or logically disordered, referred to as "hallucinations," \cite{li2024text} especially in complex or data-scarce domains. This study introduces a text generation hallucination detection framework based on factual and semantic consistency to identify and correct hallucinations in text generation. Systematic experiments were designed to validate the model, laying a foundation for subsequent text analysis. By applying this mechanism to general text generation, we enhanced the factual accuracy and logical consistency of the generated text, offering a more robust and trustworthy solution for natural language generation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{(1) BERT Layer:} The BERT layer captures deep semantic features of each word in the text through a pre-trained deep bi-directional language model. For input text \(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\), the BERT layer encodes it into hidden states \(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n\), where
    \[
    h_i = \text{BERT}(x_i).
    \]
    \item \textbf{(2) BiLSTM Layer:} The BiLSTM layer, with its forward and backward LSTM networks, accurately captures the temporal association between entities and their descriptions in lengthy texts. This layer takes the output from the BERT layer \(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n\) and outputs hidden vectors \(h_1', h_2', \dots, h_n'\), where
    \[
    h_{i1}' = \text{LSTM}_{\text{forward}}(h_i), \quad h_{i2}' = \text{LSTM}_{\text{backward}}(h_i),
    \]
    and the final hidden state is given by
    \[
    h_i' = h_{i1}' \oplus h_{i2}'.
    \]
    \item \textbf{(3) MLP Layer:} The MLP layer integrates and weights entities and their descriptions through a multi-layer network structure, taking the output of the BiLSTM layer as input and outputting integrated features \(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n\), where
    \[
    c_i = \text{MLP}(h_i').
    \]
    \item \textbf{(4) CRF Layer:} The CRF layer improves the accuracy of entity recognition by optimizing the final tagging sequence, considering the dependency between adjacent tags. It takes the output of the MLP layer \(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n\) and generates the final tagging sequence \(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n\). The computation formula is as follows:
    \[
    p(y|x) = \frac{\exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^n W_{i, y_{i-1}} + b_{y_i}\right)}{\sum_{y'} \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^n W_{i, y'_i} + b_{y'_i}\right)},
    \]
    where \(W\) and \(b\) are the CRF layer's weights and biases, respectively.
\end{itemize}

The BERT-BiLSTM-MLP-CRF model employs a multi-task learning loss function composed of two main parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Entity Recognition Loss:} Generated by the CRF layer to maximize the probability of the correct label sequence, using the negative log-likelihood loss from the CRF layer's output, expressed as:
    \[
    L_{\text{entity}} = - \sum_{i=1}^N \log p(y_i | x_i),
    \]
    where \(N\) is the number of training samples, with \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) representing the model's input and label sequence, respectively.
    \item \textbf{Description Information Recognition Loss:} Utilizes Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) for recognizing descriptive information, treating it as a classification task for each possible descriptive information label. The loss function is expressed as:
    \[
    L_{\text{desc}} = -\frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M \left[ y_j' \log \left(\sigma(x_j')\right) + (1 - y_j') \log \left(1 - \sigma(x_j')\right) \right],
    \]
    where \(M\) is the number of possible descriptive information labels, \(x_j'\) is the model's predictive output for the \(j\)-th descriptive information label, \(y_j'\) is the corresponding true label, and \(\sigma\) is the sigmoid function.
\end{enumerate}
The total model loss is a weighted sum of these two parts:
\[
L_{\text{total}} = \alpha L_{\text{entity}} + \beta L_{\text{desc}},
\]
where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are the weights that control the contribution of each loss term.

\subsubsubsection{Overview of the Chinese Entity Comparison Network, CESI-Net}
CESI-Net (Chinese Entity Similarity Inference Network) is a network specifically designed for Chinese texts. It evaluates whether the descriptions of entities in the generated text are consistent with those in Wikipedia by calculating similarity scores and inference scores between entities and their descriptions in the text and corresponding entity descriptions in Wikipedia. The structure of CESI-Net is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:CESI-Net}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{CESI-Net.png}
    \caption{Structure of CESI-Net}
    \label{fig:CESI-Net}
\end{figure}

CESI-Net utilizes the previously mentioned BERT-BiLSTM-MLP-CRF model to extract entities and their descriptions from the text. These extracted entities and descriptions are then fed into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model the complex relationships between entities. The GNN updates node features to learn the semantic associations between entities, thus producing a comprehensive entity relationship graph. Subsequently, the output from the GNN is input into Sentence-BERT and RoBERTa models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sentence-BERT:} Used to calculate the similarity score (Score1) between the entity descriptions in the text and those in Wikipedia.
    \item \textbf{RoBERTa:} Assesses the inference score (Score2) between the entity descriptions in the text and Wikipedia.
\end{itemize}
The final score is calculated by combining the similarity score (Score1) and inference score (Score2) through a weighted average.



\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{MultiSem-BERT.png}
    \caption{Structure of the MultiSem-BERT Model}
    \label{fig:MultiSem-BERT}
\end{figure}

The model consists of the following mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Token-Level Attention Mechanism:} This mechanism focuses on analyzing the relationship between each word in a sentence pair and all words in the other sentence. For each word, the model generates a weighted token-level representation by calculating its relationship weights with all words in the other sentence.
    \item \textbf{Sentence-Level Attention Mechanism:} Concentrates on analyzing the global semantic relationship between sentences. The sentence is first segmented using the Jieba segmentation library, and then different weights are assigned based on part of speech (such as nouns, verbs, and conjunctions). The model then calculates the relationship weight between sentences to obtain a sentence-level weighted representation.
\end{itemize}

The MultiSem-BERT model utilizes a weighted loss function from multitask learning to simultaneously optimize contradiction detection and topic consistency detection tasks. Both tasks use the binary cross-entropy loss function, with the calculation formula being the same as Equation~\ref{eq:loss}. The total loss function of the model is a weighted sum of the losses from both tasks, with the weights being learnable parameters.

\subsection{Retrieval-augmented generation}
\subsubsection{INTRODUCTION}
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (\cite{10763024})(\cite{chaubey2024comparative})is an advanced technique for developing language and logic models (LLMs) that effectively utilize extensive knowledge sources to produce comprehensive responses. RAG finds numerous applications in NLP, including dialogue eneration, question-answering, and summarization. However, as RAG technology gains traction and becomes more prevalent, it also encounters growing security challenges and risks. This blog post will explore the security surrounding RAG-based applications and offer key strategies and best practices for safeguarding RAG systems. To produce actual output for tasks such as translating languages, answering queries, and completing incomplete sentences, In this paper, a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to train the model. It uses billions of parameters to produce various outputs like completing entences, question-answering, and translating language. LLM with RAG enhances the model's performance and increases the model's capacity on particular domains or internal sources/
information of the association without retaining the model. Compared to traditional pproaches, the LLM is more costeffective and improves the performance and output of the RAG model to be more reliable, useful, and accurate. Artificial intelligence (AI) utilizes powerful, intelligent NLP and chatbot-based applications of the LLM is one of the key models. The main goal is to develop a chatbot that can answer the user's questions in every aspect by referring to previous existing data sources. However, the model has some challenges in generating the output. Challenges in LLMs: It provides false information when it doesn’t know the correct answer. When the user expects a particular current response, if it doesn’t know, it gives the past data or information. It also
produces accurate source information for the users. Technology confusion creates inaccurate results, whereas other training software uses the same technologies to produce 
results.


    \subsubsection{Uses of LLM in RAG:} Based on the existing known data, the LLM model creates input for the user and generates a response. Meanwhile, instead of analyzing previous data from the new user input data source, the RAG application fetches all the information to create a response. Then, the retrieved information is transferred to the LLM model. Now, the LLM model compares the obtained and existing data and produces accurate results. To create a knowledge library from the external data, the LMM model trains and stores various types of data such as database, document, or API repositories gathered from outside sources. To improve the model's performance, all the input data are converted into uniform format because the format of each data is varied, such as file, database, numeric, etc. So, an AI-based technique embeddinglanguage model is applied to converter the external data in LLM into a uniform format and store it in a vector database. This will make it easier for the model to understand the data in the library. The next step in LMM is the relevancy search, which checks the current and previous data in the vector database to generate the response. For example, let’s take an intelligent chatbot that can answer all the human doubts that AI knows. The accurate result was calculated based on the previous calculation and information. Next, prompt evaluation is performed by the RAG model by adding the relevant data into the context. In this phase, a prompt engineering technique is applied to create communication with LLM. This technique allowed the LMM model to produce more accurate results for the user questions or queries. The next phase is updating external data. This step is mainly performed to update external data and retrieve useful information. It is achieved through periodic batching or automated real-time processing techniques.

        \caption{LLM-Based Data Retrieval}
        \label{fig:LLM-RAG}
    \end{figure}
    \subsubsection{Benefits of RAG with LLM:} The RAG-based application provides various benefits to AI-based organizations or applications. The function of the chatbot is performed based on the foundation model (FM). It is an API of LLM trained using unlabelled or generalized data. However, the computational cost of FM in a particular domain or organization is high. Implementing RAG with LLM is more cost-effective and makes the AI technique easier to access. Even if the original data suits the user's queries, maintaining and checking relevancy is challenging. It is achieved by implementing RAG with LLM. Combining RAG with LLM produces more accurate results and essential user information. This can gain more trust and hope for the AI results. With this deep research, LLM can provide users with the latest and most relatable information. Due to these benefits, in this paper, the LLM model is proposed and experimented with to tighten the security system and protect the input data of the RAG application. The efficiency of the model is verified using various simulation results. The following section discusses earlier research work, the workflow of the proposed model, the model result, and the conclusion
